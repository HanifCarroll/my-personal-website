					<p>I started my programming journey in 2017 after deciding to no longer pursue a career in physical therapy.</p>
					<p>I quickly fell in love with the combination of creativity and logic that software development offered.</p>
					<p>
						Today, I use TypeScript as my tool of choice to build solutions ranging from simple scripts to complex web and even mobile
						applications.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of programming, I love to stay active. I've been lifting weights for over 17 years, and I've set a
						<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PVlCDpwb9Y' target='_blank'>deadlift record</a> in a powerlifting competition.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favorite things to do is meeting new people who are as curious as they are passionate. So, if that describes you,
						let's talk!
